<h2> About Me <h2>
 
<h3>The TLDR</h3>

I'm a competent, meticulous, and reliable developer looking to deliver value while advancing skills in software engineering and AI/ML. You'll find that I'm a fast, self-learner and strong communicator ready to succeed in collaborative or independent environments. I possess an extensive technical background honed by experience in both information technology & computer science, prepared to excel in any computing role.

<h3> A little more...</h3>

I've been building, repairing, & simply having fun with computers and electronics since I was around 9 years old. Gradually, passion, fascination, & a natural aptitude for problem solving propelled me into the world of IT where I served countless members of my community in a plethora of settings. In the IT space, I have worked on various projects for SME & individuals. Some of these projects include: building/repairing desktops/laptops, data recovery, batch technology deployment, network & VoIP configuration, data migration, security assessment, & more. 

However, one reaches a point after so many years in IT, where the surface level is no longer enough to satisfy a curious mind. I pursued my Bachelor's with the objective of pivoting away from IT and getting deeper into the fundamentals of computing, mathematics, & software. It has given me a firm foundation, valuable skills, and relevant perspective of the field. It also created new avenues of interest which required furthering my education.

Near the end of my Bachelor's degree, I found myself fascinated with machine learning. Therefore, I pursued a Master's degree specifically to develop & extend my competency in AI/ML. Consequently, I enter the job market with a strong preference & passion for AI/ML type roles. However, I do not fear learning and am always open to advancing or expanding my skills in other computing niches.
